This is a solution to the [Weather app challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/weather-app-K1FhddVm49). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects. 




### What I learned

I learned how to us asycronus JS  with fetch.
Through this project my understanding of DOM manipulations also improved greatly.

This project was also used as an opportunity to learn Sass SCSS.

I must say I enjoyed working using SCSS compared to vanilla CSS 


### Continued development

One of the area I need to work on is logic building, I really struggled with it during this project hopefully i can improved on this next few months.

My debugging skils has improved alot but I need to get better at debugging, I strugged alot with debugging during this project.


### Useful resources
Documentation from MDN and W3School helped me immensly.

40 days of JavaScript from tapasScript on Youtube is a life saver, his explanations were like strucking a goldmines. 

Gemini and Claude were also helpful in debugging and logic building.
